## Mike Wazowski Encryption/Decryption

Or more accurately known as a _Myszkowski Transition Cipher_

This is a form of columnar cipher that can be used to encrypt and decrypt plain text.

To use, run the `mike_wazowski.rb` file with two command line arguments- the key followed by the file containing the desired text.

An example of this would be `ruby mike_wazowski.rb rotor ./test/code_test_2.txt`
